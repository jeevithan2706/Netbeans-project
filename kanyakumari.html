                     philosopher Valluvar, author of the Tirukkural, an ancient Tamil work on Dharma and morality. It is located atop a

                      where two seas and an ocean meet. The statue was sculpted by the Indian sculptor V. Ganapati Sthapati, who also
                       created the Iraivan Temple, and was unveiled on the millennium day of 1 January 2000 by the then Chief Minister
                        M. Karunanidhi.
                     It is currently the 25th tallest statue in India.

                The views of the sunrise and sunset are exceptionally breathtaking when seen from the view tower, and this is perhaps
                 precisely why visitors flock to this destination in large numbers all year round. In fact, tourists claim that from 
                 the view tower, they feel as if they can touch the sun even though it is at a distance: this is how magnificent the
                  views are. The gentle breeze and the captivating beauty of the view tower enchant one's mind and refresh the mind 
                  and soul. The place is also the perfect spot for photographers to capture the beauties and bounties of nature. All
                   of these factors make the View Tower a must visit site in all of Kanykamuri, and you should include it in your
                    itinerary while here in this part of south India.
